# skyux-restricted-view

This library allows Blackbaud internal users to hide content in their SPAs from unauthenticated users. The intent here is to create a more targeted experience for users consuming Blackbaud documentation. To use the library you can either wrap your restricted content in `skyux-restricted-view` tags, or add the `skyuxRestrictedView` attribute to your restricted element. Read the [official documentation]() for more information.
